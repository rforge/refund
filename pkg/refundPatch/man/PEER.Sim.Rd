\title{
Simulated longitudinal data with functional predictor and scalar response, and structural information associated with predictor function }

\description{
\code{PEER.Sim} contains simulated observations from 100 subjects, each observed at 4 distinct timepoints. At each timepoint bumpy predictor profile is generated randomly and the scalar response variable is generated considering a time-varying regression function and subject intercept. Accompanying the functional predictor and scalar response are the subject ID numbers and time of measurements. 

\code{Q} represents the 7 x 100 matrix where each row provides structural information about the functional predictor profile for data \code{PEER.Sim}. For specific details about the simulation and Q matrix, please refer to Kundu et. al. (2012).

\usage{
data(PEER.Sim)
data(Q)
}

\format{The data frame \code{PEER.Sim} is made up of subject ID number(\code{id}), subject-specific time of measurement (\code{t}), functional predictor profile (\code{W.1-W.100}) and scalar response  (\code{Y})}
